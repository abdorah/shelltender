# Shell Script Server

Welcome to the Shell Script Server project! This project aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly way to learn and write shell scripts. By leveraging a colorful and intuitive UI, you can focus on what you want to do rather than how to achieve it. At the end, you can get the generated script to customize it however you like.

## Features

- Interactive UI
- Find and replace in a file
- Find in a folder
- Sort by column
- Show less file content
- SSH connection
- SCP copy files
- Move and copy files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `sh` installed. This script should work on most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shell-script-server.git
    cd shell-script-server
    ```

2. Make sure all scripts are executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x main.sh welcome.sh help.sh find_and_replace.sh find_in_folder.sh sort_by_column.sh show_less_file_content.sh ssh_connection.sh scp_copy_files.sh move_and_copy.sh
    ```

### Usage

Run the `main.sh` script to start the interactive UI:
```sh
./main.sh
